# Real-Time Object Tracking

## 📋 Project Overview:
Real-Time Object Tracking is a tool that uses advanced YOLO (You Only Look Once) models to detect and track objects in real-time. It allows users to process video streams or images, identifying and tracking multiple objects simultaneously with high accuracy. The app provides an intuitive interface where users can select from different YOLO models and view detected objects in live webcam feeds or uploaded files.

## 🔍 YOLO Model
 ✅ **YOLOv8n (Nano):**
- Smallest and fastest model, ideal for devices with low computational power.
  
 ✅ **YOLOv8s (Small):**
- Balances speed and accuracy for moderately constrained environments.
  
 ✅ **YOLOv8m (Medium):**
- Higher accuracy with moderate computational demand.
  
 ✅ **YOLOv8l (Large):**
- Highest accuracy but requires more resources.

## 📌 Dataset Used:
The project utilizes the COCO Dataset (Common Objects in Context) for object detection. This dataset includes 80 diverse object classes like humans, animals, vehicles, and furniture. It provides labeled bounding boxes, making it suitable for training YOLO models.

## 🛠️ Project Components:
 **YOLO Models and Configuration:**
- Pre-trained YOLO models loaded dynamically based on user selection.

 **Input Modes:**
- Webcam: Real-time video input for dynamic detection.
- File Upload: Supports both images and video files for offline analysis.
  
 **UI and Visualization:**
- Interactive Streamlit interface with a responsive sidebar.
- Bounding boxes and labels for clear visualization of detection results.

 **Pre-Processing and Post-Processing Pipelines:**
- Handles frame capture, model inference, and rendering in real-time.

##  🤖 Technology Stack:
 ✅ Frontend:
- **Streamlit:** Interactive and user-friendly web interface.
  HTML/CSS Styling: For custom background and sidebar design.
 ✅ Backend:
